To solve the problem of finding the radius of the circular path of a charged particle moving in a magnetic field, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1:** **Determine the kinetic energy of the particle**

When a charged particle of charge \( q \) and mass \( m \) is accelerated through a potential difference \( V \), it gains kinetic energy equal to the work done by the electric field. The kinetic energy \( K \) of the particle is given by:

\[ K = qV \]

**Step 2:** **Relate kinetic energy to velocity**

The kinetic energy of the particle can also be expressed in terms of its mass and velocity \( v \):

\[ K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

Equating the two expressions for kinetic energy, we get:

\[ qV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

Solving for \( v \), the velocity of the particle, we get:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}} \]

**Step 3:** **Determine the magnetic force acting on the particle**

When the particle enters a region of uniform magnetic field \( B \) perpendicular to its velocity, it experiences a magnetic force \( F \) given by:

\[ F = qvB \]

**Step 4:** **Relate magnetic force to centripetal force**

For the particle to move in a circular path, the magnetic force must provide the necessary centripetal force \( F_c \):

\[ F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} \]

Setting the magnetic force equal to the centripetal force, we get:

\[ qvB = \frac{mv^2}{r} \]

**Step 5:** **Solve for the radius \( r \) of the circular path**

Rearranging the equation to solve for \( r \), we get:

\[ r = \frac{mv}{qB} \]

Substitute the expression for \( v \) from Step 2 into this equation:

\[ r = \frac{m \left( \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}} \right)}{qB} \]

Simplify the expression:

\[ r = \frac{m \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}}}{qB} = \frac{\sqrt{2mqV}}{qB} \]

Thus, the radius of the circular path is:

\[ r = \sqrt{\frac{2mV}{qB^2}} \]

**Conclusion:**

The radius \( r \) of the circular path of the charged particle in the magnetic field is given by:

\[ r = \sqrt{\frac{2mV}{qB^2}} \]
